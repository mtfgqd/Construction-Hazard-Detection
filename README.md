"Construction-Hazard-Detection" is an AI-powered tool designed to enhance safety on construction sites. By leveraging the YOLO model for object detection, it identifies potential hazards such as:

- Workers without helmets
- Workers without safety vests
- Workers near machinery or vehicles
- Workers in restricted areas, restricted areas will be automatically generated by computing and clustering the coordinates of safety cones.

Post-processing algorithms further improve detection accuracy. The system is built for real-time deployment, offering instant analysis and alerts for identified hazards.

Additionally, the system integrates AI recognition results in real-time via a web interface. It can send notifications and real-time on-site images through messaging apps like LINE, Messenger, WeChat, and Telegram for prompt alerts and reminders. The system also supports multiple languages, enabling users to receive notifications and interact with the interface in their preferred language. Supported languages include:

- 🇹🇼 Traditional Chinese (Taiwan)
- 🇨🇳 Simplified Chinese (Mainland China)
- 🇫🇷 French
- 🇬🇧 English
- 🇹🇭 Thai
- 🇻🇳 Vietnamese
- 🇮🇩 Indonesian

This multi-language support makes the system accessible to a global audience, improving usability across different regions.

  </div>
</div>

## Usage

Before running the application, you need to configure the system by specifying the details of the video streams and other parameters in a JSON configuration file. An example configuration file `config/configuration.json` should look like this:

```json
[
  {
    "video_url": "https://cctv1.kctmc.nat.gov.tw/6e559e58/",
    "site": "Kaohsiung",
    "stream_name": "Test",
    "model_key": "yolo11n",
    "notifications": {
      "line_token_1": "language_1",
      "line_token_2": "language_2"
    },
    "detect_with_server": true,
    "expire_date": "2024-12-31T23:59:59",
    "detection_items": {
      "detect_no_safety_vest_or_helmet": true,
      "detect_near_machinery_or_vehicle": true,
      "detect_in_restricted_area": true
    },
    "work_start_hour": 7,
    "work_end_hour": 18,
    "store_in_redis": true
  },
  {
    "video_url": "streaming URL",
    "site": "Factory_1",
    "stream_name": "camera_1",
    "model_key": "yolo11n",
    "notifications": {
      "line_token_3": "language_3",
      "line_token_4": "language_4"
    },
    "detect_with_server": false,
    "expire_date": "No Expire Date",
    "detection_items": {
      "detect_no_safety_vest_or_helmet": true,
      "detect_near_machinery_or_vehicle": false,
      "detect_in_restricted_area": true
    },
    "work_start_hour": 0,
    "work_end_hour": 24,
    "store_in_redis": true
  }
]
```

Each object in the array represents a video stream configuration with the following fields:

- `video_url`: The URL of the live video stream. This can include:
   - Surveillance streams
   - RTSP streams
   - Secondary streams
   - YouTube videos or live streams
   - Discord streams

- `site`: The location of the monitoring system (e.g., construction site, factory).

- `stream_name`: The name assigned to the camera or stream (e.g., "Front Gate", "Camera 1").

- `model_key`: The key identifier for the machine learning model to use (e.g., "yolo11n").

- `notifications`: A list of LINE messaging API tokens and corresponding languages for sending notifications.
   - `line_token_1`, `line_token_2`, etc.: These are the LINE API tokens.
   - `language_1`, `language_2`, etc.: The languages for the notifications (e.g., "en" for English, "zh-TW" for Traditional Chinese).

   Supported languages for notifications include:
   - `zh-TW`: Traditional Chinese
   - `zh-CN`: Simplified Chinese
   - `en`: English
   - `fr`: French
   - `vi`: Vietnamese
   - `id`: Indonesian
   - `th`: Thai

   For information on how to obtain a LINE token, please refer to [line_notify_guide_en](docs/en/line_notify_guide_en.md).

- `detect_with_server`: Boolean value indicating whether to run object detection using a server API. If `True`, the system will use the server for object detection. If `False`, object detection will run locally on the machine.

- `expire_date`: Expire date for the video stream configuration in ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2024-12-31T23:59:59"). If there is no expiration date, a string like "No Expire Date" can be used.

- `detection_items`: Specifies the safety detection items for monitoring specific scenarios. Each item can be set to `True` to enable or `False` to disable. The available detection items are:
   - `detect_no_safety_vest_or_helmet`: Detects if a person is not wearing a safety vest or helmet. This is essential for monitoring compliance with safety gear requirements on sites where such equipment is mandatory for personnel protection.
   - `detect_near_machinery_or_vehicle`: Detects if a person is dangerously close to machinery or vehicles. This helps prevent accidents caused by close proximity to heavy equipment or moving vehicles, often encountered in construction sites or industrial areas.
   - `detect_in_restricted_area`: Detects if a person has entered a restricted or controlled area. Restricted areas may be dangerous for untrained personnel or may contain sensitive equipment, so this setting aids in controlling access to such zones.

- `work_start_hour`: Specifies the hour (in 24-hour format) when the system should start monitoring the video stream. This allows monitoring to be restricted to active work hours, reducing unnecessary processing outside the defined timeframe (e.g., `7` for 7:00 AM).

- `work_end_hour`: Specifies the hour (in 24-hour format) when the system should stop monitoring the video stream. Monitoring will cease after this time to optimise resource usage (e.g., `18` for 6:00 PM).

   Together, `work_start_hour` and `work_end_hour` define the monitoring period during a day. For 24-hour monitoring, set `work_start_hour` to `0` and `work_end_hour` to `24`.

- `store_in_redis`: A boolean value that determines whether to store processed frames and associated detection data in Redis. If `True`, the system will save the data to a Redis database for further use, such as real-time monitoring or integration with other services. If `False`, no data will be saved in Redis.
